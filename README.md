# Spanish-High-School-Structural-Network-Analysis
Network theory serves as a vital tool in understanding complex systems, transcending disciplinary boundaries to offer insights into various fields of research. High schools, as microcosms of society, present intriguing subjects for network analysis, reflecting broader societal structures and dynamics. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive structural analysis of a Spanish high school network, aiming to elucidate the implications of its structure on social interactions. Our analysis reveals how the networkâ€™s topology intricately captures sociological information, reflecting the underlying social dynamics within the educational setting. Ultimately, this study underscores the relevance of network theory in unraveling the complexities of social structures, offering valuable unbiased insights into the fundamental dynamics of human social behaviour.

In this repository, we present the numerical implementation for the structural analysis.
